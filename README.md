## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate computational biologist who is fascinated with what happen in the cell at molecular level. I found it extremely intriguing to dive deep into the realm of omics data analysis in order to decipher the code of life. To me, cancer is a controlled chaos. An rochestrated frizz with mysteries coded within the genome, epigenome, transcriptome and metabolome. I want to uncover these mysteries.
Currently, I am completing an internship position in computational biology at biophysics and pathphysiology group in the department of biomedical science at Veterinary Medicine Uinversity, Vienna, Austria.

 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning single cell RNA-Seq data ananlysis and multiomics.
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in spatial transcriptomics and machine learning application in genomics .

 - âš¡ Fun fact:
1) I'm a techno-optimist! I might be interested in Sci-fi movies (my main source of inspiration for scientific passions) which depicts the time when technology eliminate humans, but I do believe that at the end of the day technology is usefull for humanity and help us to have a better life (with some inevitable side effects though).
2) I have been told too many times that I would end up as a "Jack of all trades and master of none" person. However, the full qoute is "Jack of all trades and master of none, though often times better than a master of one".
