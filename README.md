## Hi there 👋
I'm a passionate computational biologist who is fascinated with what happen in the cell at molecular level. I found it extremely intriguing to dive deep into the realm of omic data analysis in order to decipher the code of life.
Currently I am completing an internship position in computational biology at the department of biophysics and pathphysiology in Veterinary Medicine Uinversity, Vienna, Austria.

 - 🔭 I’m currently learning single cell RNA-Seq data ananlysis and multiomics.
 - 🌱 I’m interested in Cancer genomics, spatial transcriptomics and multiomics.

 - ⚡ Fun fact:
1) I'm a techno-optimist! I might be interested in Sci-fi movies (my main source of inspiration for scientific passions) which depicts the time when technology eliminate humans, but I do believe that at the end of the day technology is usefull for humanity and help us to have a better life (with some inevitable side effects though).
2) I have been told too many times that I would end up as a "Jack of all trades and master of none!" person. However, the full qoute is "Jack of all trades and master of none, though often times better than a master of one".
