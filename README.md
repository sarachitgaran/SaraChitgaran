## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate computational biologist who is fscinated with what happen in the cell at molecular level. I found it extremely intriguing to dive deep into the realm of omic data analysis in order to decipher the code of life.

Currently I am completing an internship position in computational biology at the department of biophysics and pathphysiology in Veterinary Medicine Uinversity, Vienna, Austria.

 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning single cell RNA-Seq data ananlysis and multiomics
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in Cancer genomics, spatial transcriptomics and multiomics
